Color Boxs — Simple Logic & Luck Game

Color Boxs is a small, fun game based on tapping boxes to change their numbers and colors.
Your goal is to make all 5 boxes the same color using the minimum number of taps.

🧩 How the Game Works

You start with 5 boxes.
Each box has:

A number (starting at 0)

A color that depends on the number


When you tap a box:

Its number changes randomly

Its color updates based on the new number


🎨 Color Rules

Condition	Color

number % 3 == 0	🔴 Red
number % 5 == 0	🟢 Green
number % 3 == 0 AND number % 5 == 0	🟡 Gold
otherwise	(you decide — normal/default color)


💡 Gold counts as both Red and Green, and you may treat it as either color when matching.

🏆 How to Win

You win when all 5 boxes have the same color.

Try to achieve this using the smallest number of taps.

If you play with a friend, the one who reaches the matching color with fewer taps is the winner.
